    <h1><p><i>Krishnarajapuram (KR Puram) is an eastern suburb of Bangalore, Karnataka, located at the junction of the Old Madras Road and Outer Ring Road. It is a residential and commercial hub that has grown significantly due to its proximity to IT parks and is known for its connectivity and housing developments, though it also faces challenges like heavy traffic and pollution. The area's history dates back to around 750 AD and is named after a ruler from the Wodeyar dynasty.</i></p></h1>
